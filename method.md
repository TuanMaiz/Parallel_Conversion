  1. Overall Methodological Approach

  Our approach addresses the fundamental challenge of converting
  transformer-based Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) to Spiking Neural
  Networks (SNNs) while maintaining computational efficiency and accuracy. We
  propose a novel hybrid architecture that integrates Distribution-Aware
  Quantized Clipped Feature Scaling (DA-QCFS) with parallel spiking neurons
  specifically designed for text processing.

  Core Methodological Framework:
  - Layer-wise Replacement: Strategic replacement of ReLU activations with
  QCFS layers
  - Distribution-Aware Calibration: Per-hidden-dimension quantization for
  transformer activations
  - Parallel Inference: Time-parallel spiking computation for accelerated
  inference
  - Text-Specific Optimization: Custom neuron architectures for sequence-based
   data

  2. Why Our Approach is the Right Solution

  Theoretical Foundation:
  Traditional ANN-to-SNN conversion methods suffer from several limitations
  when applied to transformer architectures:

  1. Information Loss: Direct thresholding of ReLU outputs loses critical
  activation patterns
  2. Temporal Disruption: Sequential spiking fails to capture parallel nature
  of attention mechanisms
  3. Distribution Mismatch: Standard quantization doesn't account for
  transformer activation distributions

  Our approach addresses these challenges through:

  Distribution-Aware QCFS:
  class DA_QCFS_Text(nn.Module):
      def __init__(self, hidden_size, T, is_relu=False):
          self.clip_min = nn.Parameter(torch.zeros(hidden_size),
  requires_grad=False)
          self.clip_max = nn.Parameter(torch.ones(hidden_size),
  requires_grad=False)
          self.psi = nn.Parameter(torch.zeros(hidden_size),
  requires_grad=False)
          self.phi = nn.Parameter(torch.ones(hidden_size),
  requires_grad=False)

  Key Advantages:
  - Per-Hidden-Dimension Calibration: Each neuron type has optimized
  quantization parameters
  - Distribution Alignment: Affine correction (ψ, φ) aligns quantized
  distributions
  - Preserved Information: Gradual quantization maintains activation patterns

● 3. Parallel Inference Neurons for Text

  Architectural Innovation:
  Our parallel inference neuron (ParaInfNeuron_Text) represents a departure
  from traditional sequential spiking approaches:

  class ParaInfNeuron_Text(nn.Module):
      def __init__(self, T, th=1., init_mem=0.5):
          self.T = T
          self.register_buffer('TxT', T / torch.arange(1, T+1).unsqueeze(-1))
          self.register_buffer('bias', (init_mem * th) / torch.arange(1,
  T+1).unsqueeze(-1))

  Computational Advantages:
  - Time-Parallel Processing: All timesteps processed simultaneously
  - Precomputed Scaling: TxT and bias factors precomputed for efficiency
  - Mean-Based Aggregation: Temporal mean computation followed by parallel
  scaling

  Mathematical Formulation:
  Given input activation x ∈ ℝ^(B×S×H), the parallel inference neuron
  computes:

  x̄ = (1/T) ∑_{t=1}^T x_t  # Temporal mean
  y_t = (x̄ · TxT_t + bias_t) ≥ v_threshold  # Parallel thresholding
  ŷ = (1/T) ∑_{t=1}^T y_t  # Temporal aggregation

  4. BERT Integration Architecture

  Layer-Wise Replacement Strategy:
  We replace BERT's intermediate layers while preserving the core attention
  mechanisms:

  Original BERT Layer:
      Attention → ReLU → Linear → Output
  Modified BERT Layer:
      Attention → DA-QCFS → Parallel Spiking → Linear → Output

  Implementation Details:
  class BertLayerQCFS(nn.Module):
      def __init__(self, config, T=4):
          self.attention = BertAttention(config)           # Preserved
          self.intermediate_qcfs = BertIntermediateQCFS(config, T)  # Replaced
          self.output = BertOutput(config)                 # Preserved
